# fuzz_IoT_sample

Here are some code snippets of our project "***Temporal Specification Oriented Fuzzing for Trigger-Action-Programming Smart Home Integrations***". We are intended to spot subtle but significant safety problems inside events-driven IoT systems (Smart-things / IFTTT for example). We are right now close to this work's end and hopefully we shall submit paper concerning to *ISSTA'25*.
